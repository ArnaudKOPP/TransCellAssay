#TransCellAssay

This Python packages is for analysis of Transfected Cell Assay in High Throughput Screening environment.   
Data input is designed to be Single Cell data but 1data/well will work also.


##HOW TO USE IT
It will certainly be like a toolbox for the moment, so programming skill is needed.

### What TCA do :
1. Controls based and non-controls based normalization, logarithmic transformation
2. Systematic Error Detection Test
3. Systematics error Correction with Bscore, BZscore, PMP, MEA, DiffusionModel and basic background Correction/Well Correction
4. Quality Control 
5. Scoring (SSMD, T-Statistics,...)

### TODO
1. Machine Learning ( classification, clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, ...)
2. Bayesian Inference (FDR...)
3. GSEA, PP-interaction, -Omics data interaction
4. Web interface

##DEPENDENCIES

#TransCellAssay

This Python packages is for analysis of Transfected Cell Assay in High Throughput Screening environment.   
Data input is designed to be Single Cell data but 1data/well will work also.
This package has been designed with the aim to facilitate the development of data analysis pipeline, so programming skills are needed for the moment. 
This package was developped and tested on python 3.4. It can replace CellHTS2 or similar software

### What TCA do :

* Quality Control for control, data consistency across replicat (check if data are missing)
* Controls based and non-controls based normalization, logarithmic transformation, feature scaling
* Systematic Error Detection Test
* Systematics error Correction with Bscore, BZscore, PMP, MEA, DiffusionModel and basic background Correction/Well Correction
* Scoring (SSMD, T-Statistics, Rank product, single cell properties)
* GO enrichment, pathways enrichment, PPI, KEGG, STRING, Panther, Biogrid, ... 

##Python Module Dependencies

* Python 3.4
* Pandas 
* Numpy 
* Scipy 
* Matplotlib, seaborn
* Scikit-learn 
* requests, beautifulsoup4 for REST part
* xlsxwriter

Python package in most recent version is a must

##Principale Idea to implement

* Machine Learning like clustering or classification of hit
* Bayesian Inference (FDR...)
* PP-interaction
* RNA-seq data from multiple cell lines
* Dose Response Analysis
* Phenotypic Response
* A lot more graphics (Screen hit map, ...)

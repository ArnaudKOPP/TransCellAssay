"""
Calculates the T-test for the means of TWO INDEPENDENT samples of scores.
This is a two-sided test for the null hypothesis that 2 independent samples have identical average (expected) values.
This test assumes that the populations have identical variances.

We can use this test, if we observe two independent samples from the same or different population, e.g. exam scores of
boys and girls or of two ethnic groups. The test measures whether the average (expected) value differs significantly
across samples. If we observe a large p-value, for example larger than 0.05 or 0.1, then we cannot reject the null
hypothesis of identical average scores. If the p-value is smaller than the threshold, e.g. 1%, 5% or 10%, then we
reject the null hypothesis of equal averages.

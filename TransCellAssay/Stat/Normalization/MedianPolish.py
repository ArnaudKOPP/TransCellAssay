"""
Tukey's two-ways median polish is utilized to calculate the row and col effect within plates using a non-controls-based
approach. In this method, the row and col medians are iteratively subtracted from all wells until the maximum tolerance
value is reached for the row and col medians as wells as for the row and col effect. The residuals in plate are then
calculated bu subtracting the estimated plate average, row effect and col effect from the true sample value. Since
median parameter is used in the calculations, this method is relatively insensitive to outliers.

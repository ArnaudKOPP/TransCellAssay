"""
Tukey's two-ways median polish is utilized to calculate the row and col effect within plates using a non-controls-based
approach. In this method, the row and col medians are iteratively subtracted from all wells until the maximum tolerance
value is reached for the row and col medians as wells as for the row and col effect. The residuals in plate are then
calculated bu subtracting the estimated plate average, row effect and col effect from the true sample value. Since
median parameter is used in the calculations, this method is relatively insensitive to outliers.
-Bscore : this is a normalization parameters which involves the residual values calculated from median polish and the
sample MAD to account for data variability.
-BZscore : This is a modified version of Bscore method, where the median polish is followed by zscore calculations.
While BSscore is more advantageous to Zscore  because of its capability to correct for row and col effect, it is less
powerful than Bscore and does not fit very well with the normal distribution model.

trimmed mean : cut the outside limit default = 0.0 so its equivalent to the 'standard' mean.

"""
This method follows an analogous strategy to the background correction method; however, a least-squares approximation
or polynomial fitting is performed independently for each well accross all plates. The fitted value are then substracted
from each data point to obtain the corrected data set. In a study comparing the systematic error correction methods
discussed so far, well-correction method was found to be the most effective for succesful "hit" selection.

The well correction method consist of two main steps:
    -Least-squares approximation of the data carried out separatly for each well of the array(screen)
    -Zscore normalization of the data within each well location of the assay

For the analysis of large industrial assays, more sophisticated function like higher degree polynomial or spline
functions can also be used.
Experimental values for a specific well location can be also have ascending or descending trends. The well correction
procedure first discovers these trends using the linear least-squares approximation; note that fitting by a polynomial
approximation of a higher degree can be also carried out instead of the linear approximation. Thus, the obtained trend
(a straight line y = ax + b in case of the linear fitting, where x denotes the plate number and y denotes the plate
normalized measurement ) is subtracted from or added to the original measurement bringing te mean value of this well
to zero
